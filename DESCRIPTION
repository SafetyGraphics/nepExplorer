Description: nepExplorer enables safety professionals to explore clinical trial laboratory
    data and identify instances of acute declines in renal function. "Drill down" capabilities 
    provide a means to evaluate subject-level data. The tool is accompanied by a comprehensive
    clinical workflow that guides the user through a series of evaluations each with a textual 
    discussion regarding the goal of the evaluation step and the relevance of any findings with
    references to the supporting nephrology literature. nepExplorer is designed as a Shiny 
    application that can be used stand-alone or configured within the safetyGraphics framework.
